## Introduction
Nowadays people don't have to rely on their own ability to perform calculations that are not always necessarily difficult. Instead prefererring to use a phone or even a watch to calculate the cost of the electricity and gas bill combined.

The computer obviously gives the correct answer however people are not relying on their own ability to perform calculations. Over time this ability is reduced. 

The brain is similiar to any other muscle in the body and if parts of it are not used, over time capacity is reduced. Playing games such as this for a few minutes each day is a way to maintain and train your brain.
